### Project Focus

This project aims to model gas turbine behavior using a novel knowledge-guided deep learning approach. It addresses challenges in modeling dynamical systems, where traditional deep learning methods often struggle due to physical inconsistencies and generalization issues. The goal is to provide a more accurate, reliable, and physically consistent model for gas turbines.


## Getting Started

To set up the environment for this project:

```bash
conda env create - f env.yml
```

## Code Structure

- `src/dataset.py`: Data loading and preprocessing functionalities.
- `src/model.py`: LSTM for gas turbine simulation.
- `src/loss_functions.py`: Custom loss function incorporating knowledge-guided constraints.
- `src/utils.py`: Utility functions supporting data handling and model operations.
-  'data' : Place the csv files with experimental data there. You can find the data [here](https://doi.org/10.35097/sLJiahifxvfDKMEc). 

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Experiment Suite**: Script (`run_experiments.py`) to reproduce experiments from the paper.
- **Organizing results**: Jupyter notebook `Collect_Results.ipynb' to collect experimental results to one pandas dataframe.
- **Visualize Results**: The experimental results, including the code used to create the figures and the figures themselves, can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.35097/sLJiahifxvfDKMEc).
