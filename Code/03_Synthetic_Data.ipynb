    "# Creation of Synthetic data\n",
    "\n",
    "This file is used for the creation of synthetic data. We try to mimic the behavior of dynamic systems by creating data which have a stationary phase and a transition phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stationary phase is determined by a quadratic function ($q_1 * x^2 + q_2 * x + q_3$). The transition phases are determined by a linear function ($l_1 * x + l_2$). The functions are selected according to the knowledge provided by the experts. Other functions can be adapted easily. The parameters q_1, q_2 and l_1 can be selected as one wishes using the variables in the parameters section a few cells down. We chose the parameters q_3 and l_2 to be 0 since it models our use case the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two ways to create data series. The first is a \"hand-made\" procedure having three jumps but also 2 smaller \"continuity-like\" jumps. The other way is a completely random series depending on the number of jumps. As an input we choose random values out of [0, 10], as time inputs we choose random integers out of [0, 10000]."
